# nlp-emoji

This project was created as a very small proof-of-concept in about a day to try out the Cohere Embedding API, and is built using Flask and Bootstrap/Sass.

## Usage
Find matches for your search terms from the set of Unicode emojis, particularly helpful for suggesting reasonable alternatives if a direct match doesn't exist. 

Note: the results are currently of inconsistent quality with further refinement (prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, etc.) needed.

Example queries: "Picasso", "chewing gum", "identity", "tumultuous"
